		Here is some text. I've created it because I was instructed to do so by the course website, however I have now had the chance 		to spend a little time with its creator and I am concerned that he may not have my best interests at heart. I have not known 			him for long but I suspect he is not to be trusted. Apparently his name is Martyn Birch, although I am convinced this is some 		sort of alias. I will leave this message here in the hope that more people will find it and that his true nature may 			  eventually be revealed. <br><br>
		
		
		I believe that Martyn may be, or may be doing, all or none of the following things:
		
		<ul>
		
		<li>Evil</li>
		
		<li>Fiendishly clever</li>
		
		<li>Ruthless</li>
		
		<li>Selling drugs to students</li>
		
		<li>Watching me while I use the toilet</li>
		
		</ul>

		</p>
