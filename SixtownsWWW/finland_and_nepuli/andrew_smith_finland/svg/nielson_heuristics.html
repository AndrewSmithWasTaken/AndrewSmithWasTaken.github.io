    <h1>Nielson Heuristics  study of www.bbc.co.uk</h1>

	<h2>1: Visibility of System Status:</h2>

	When loading video or radio content, the BBC displays a loading icon. If content fails to load after a short time or if there is some other error such as geo-location, these are displayed clearly inside the video window, with relevant help and faq links.
	Meta information such as the when a news story was added is also available clearly above the content.<br><br>

	<h2>2: Match between system and the real world</h2>

	The BBC is a worldwide institution with a distinct and recognizable house style, indeed ‘BBC English’ is a recognized dialect. As expected therefore, the vocabulary is concise and clear and the more technical terms are hidden in links available mostly in the footer. If one wishes to delve deeper, there is extensive technical documentation available but one must search for it.<br><br>

	<h2>3: User control and freedom</h2>

	There is no real possibility to choose system functions on the website, but there is always a clear escape to the homepage in the form of a large BBC logo top right. The website itself is customizable, content can be moved, resized etc and individual sub-headings can be moved, added and/or deleted within sections e.g. News.<br><br>

	<h2>4: Consistency and standards</h2>

	The BBC is very clear across all platforms. News is news, sport is sport etc. Logos, fonts and colours etc are standardized.<br><br>

	<h2>5: Error prevention</h2>

	Not particularly relevant here. As mentioned previously, if there are any errors encountered when serving content, these are clearly explained.<br><br>

	<h2>6: Recognition rather than recall</h2>

	Again, the BBC have a standard format site-wide which is very easy to recognize across all platforms. News is themed in red, Sport is themed in yellow for example.<br><br>

	<h2>7: Flexibility and ease of use</h2>

	As mentioned previously, the physical layout of the various sections is customizable (provided one signs in). This is the most obvious accelerator but does require the creation of an account.<br><br>

	<h2>8: Aesthetic and minimalist design.</h2>

	The site makes good use of whitespace and is clear and bright. The sections are well delineated and the house style is instantly recognizable. The BBC is a global brand with a strong identity.<br><br>

	<h2>9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors</h2>

	As stated earlier, clear help is available in this area. Most errors are correctly diagnosed and reported and those which are not instantly fixable are linked to faqs and further information.<br><br>

	<h2>10: Help and documentation</h2>

	There are extensive faqs and guides as well as a large online community, all accessible from the site.<br><br>
