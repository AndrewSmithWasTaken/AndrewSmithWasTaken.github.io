Nepuli Designs was created out of pure frustration of how website designers were becoming too reliant on over bloated frameworks and forgetting the simplicity and beauty of using HTML and CSS, but instead relying on messy JavaScript to achieve the same outcome.
<br><br>
The concept of less is more has somehow been forgotten over the last 7/8 years and thus we felt something had to be done about it.<br><br>
With Nepuli Designs we strive to put design and simplicity at the forefront of website design, with content taking more of a front row seat than has previously been.
